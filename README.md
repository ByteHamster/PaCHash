# Succinct Variable-Size Object Store

Implementations for external-memory object stores that have small internal-memory space usage
and still guarantee a limited number of external IO operations.

| Method            | External memory utilization | Internal memory usage | IOs per query |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| Elias-Fano        | 100%                        | ~6 bits/page          | 1.3           |
| Separator Hashing | Up to 98%ยน                  | ~6 bits/page          | 1             |
| Cuckoo Hashing    | Up to 98%ยน                  | Constant              | 2 parallel    |

ยน Depending on the input distribution. Adversarial input can bring the utilization down to 50%.

### Building the examples

```
git clone --recursive git@gitlab.com:ByteHamster/VariableSizeObjectStore.git
mkdir VariableSizeObjectStore/build
cd VariableSizeObjectStore/build
cmake .. # First attempt fails because of a library dependency
cmake ..
make -j8
```

### Library usage

Add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt`.
Note that you need to run `cmake` twice because an error in a library dependency makes it fail the first time.

```
add_subdirectory(path/to/VariableSizeObjectStore)
target_link_libraries(YourTarget PRIVATE VariableSizeObjectStore)
```
