# PaCHash

An object store for variable-sized objects, which has small internal-memory space usage
and still guarantees a limited number of external IO operations.
For a given parameter *a*, the internal memory space usage is *2 + log(a)* bits per block.
Queries for objects of size *|x|* take constant time and fetch *1 + |x|/B + 1/a* blocks from external memory.

### Library usage

Add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt`.

```
add_subdirectory(path/to/PaCHash)
target_link_libraries(YourTarget PRIVATE PaCHash)
```

### Building the examples

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:ByteHamster/PaCHash.git
mkdir PaCHash/build
cd PaCHash/build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j
```

### Benchmarks

Alternative methods are implemented for benchmarking.
You can find the full benchmark scripts in an independent repository: https://github.com/ByteHamster/PaCHash-Experiments

| Method            | External memory utilization | Internal memory usage | IOs per query     |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| PaCHash           | 100%                        | ~6 bits/page          | 1 (variable size) |
| Separator Hashing | Up to 98%ยน                  | ~6 bits/page          | 1                 |
| Cuckoo Hashing    | Up to 98%ยน                  | Constant              | 2 parallel        |

ยน Depending on the input distribution. The methods are originally designed for fixed size objects.
Adversarial input can therefore bring the utilization down to 51% or even make construction impossible.
