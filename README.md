# PaCHash

An object store for variable-sized objects, which has small internal-memory space usage
and still guarantees a limited number of external IO operations.
Alternative methods are implemented for benchmarking.

| Method            | External memory utilization | Internal memory usage | IOs per query     |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| PaCHash           | 100%                        | ~6 bits/page          | 1 (variable size) |
| Separator Hashing | Up to 98%ยน                  | ~6 bits/page          | 1                 |
| Cuckoo Hashing    | Up to 98%ยน                  | Constant              | 2 parallel        |

ยน Depending on the input distribution. Adversarial input can bring the utilization down to 51%.
